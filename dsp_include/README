This directory should contain the headers for the DSP-side API. However, I've
been unable to find any reference to a license for these particular files, and
the headers themselves don't refer to any permission to redistribute - so I
suspect we can't put these in the dsp-code repo, for now at least.

To get the headers, download:
	http://www.openomap.org/pub/dspbridge/dspbridge_omapzoom_v1.4.tar.gz
Extract it to a directory, and from there copy the contents of
	dsp/ti/dspbridge/dsp/bridge_product/exports/include/
To the directory containing this README file.
