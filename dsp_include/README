This directory should contain the headers for the DSP-side API. However, I've
been unable to find any reference to a license for these particular files, and
the headers themselves don't refer to any permission to redistribute - so I
suspect we can't put these in the dsp-code repo, for now at least.

To get the headers, download:
	http://www.openomap.org/pub/dspbridge/dspbridge_omapzoom_v1.4.tar.gz
Extract it to a directory, and from there copy the contents of
	dsp/ti/dspbridge/dsp/bridge_product/exports/include/
To the directory containing this README file.

UPDATE

Looks like another pre-requisite is to have headers for TIs dspbios, which is
undoubtedly going to be painful. I've added four headers containing some dummy
structs, which give headers enough information to build. However, this means
queues, semaphores and some other constructs are incorrectly sized to interface
with the rest of the DSP environment. Which is OK, because hopefully we won't
be using them unless we actually touch upon dspbios, in which case we'll be
using its headers anyway.
